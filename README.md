## Drawery - open API tool
Lightweight tool for creating and proccessing bitmap images
### Platform
I'm writing this project as homework assignment, it based on **p5.js** lib.
https://p5js.org/
### Using
There's no special skills needed. Just open index.html, or paste folder on server, then open it.

### Customizing
Now you can customize project and find/fix some bugs, but in the near future we will rewrite and refactor some logics.


Feel free to improve project!
